    # List of icons
    We introduced SVG icons in version 3.9.0, replacing font icons. This has the following benefits:

    - Complete offline usage of icons, without dependency on a CDN-hosted font icon file (No more empty square during downloading and no need to deploy icon font files locally either!)
    - Much more display accuracy on lower-resolution screens
    - The ability to choose icon color
    - No need to change built-in icons with overriding styles by providing more props in component

    ``` jsx
    import { MessageOutlined } from '@ant-design/icons';

    <MessageOutlined style={{ fontSize: '16px', color: '#08c' }} />;
    ```
    All the icons will render to \<svg>. You can still set style and className for size and color of icons.
    ```jsx
    <Icon type="message" style={{ fontSize: '16px', color: '#08c' }} theme="outlined" />
    ```
